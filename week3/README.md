My approach while making the Image Carousel Slider -
The project began with the creation of the HTML structure. A container div was set up for the slideshow, and an image element with the name attribute "slide" was included.

JavaScript was employed to manage the image slider. A variable was used to keep track of the current image index. An array of image paths was created, representing the images to be displayed. A function was designed to change the image source and handle the transition to the next image. The setInterval method was utilized to automate the image transitions.

Challenges faced -
Image Paths and File Names: One of the initial challenges was ensuring that the image paths and file names were accurate. For quite a while the images refused to load due to incorrect file paths.

CSS Styling: Had to adjust the image properties to maintain aethetic. Filtered the images and excluded low resolution images from the carousel.

My approach while making the Validation form -
I began by creating the HTML structure for the registration form. I used form elements and included input fields for the username, email, password, and confirm password, along with corresponding error message placeholders.

I wrote JavaScript code to implement real-time validation. I used event listeners to trigger validation functions when the input fields lost focus

Challenges faced -
Validation Logic: Implementing validation logic for email format (using regular expressions) and ensuring password length met the criteria without overcomplicating the code was a challenge.

I utilized regular expressions to validate the email format, and I applied a simple conditional statement to check password length. This simplified the validation logic.
